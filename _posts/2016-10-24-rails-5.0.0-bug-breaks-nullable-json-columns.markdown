Getting a string value of `"null"` in your JSON columns with Rails? That is due
to a bug in Rails 5.0.0 that is incorrectly serialising a `nil` value of the
field into JSON.

Good news is that it's [already fixed][pr] and should be released with 5.0.1.
Until then you can [monkey patch][monkey-patch] a fix in.
