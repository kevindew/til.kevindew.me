Constraints breed innovation? This seems to be frequently the case in the world
of HTML e-mail. Despite a [rocky landscape of restrictions][cm-css] people
have acheived some [incredible][gmail-responsive] [things][video-email]. I was
surprised however today to get an [interactive email][dominos] from
[Dominos](https://www.dominos.co.uk/) where you can click to see
different images in a tab like interface.

Digging into view source I could see the usage was achieved using a `<label>` element
with a `<input type="radio">` inside it. Once the input is checked (via clicking the label)
the [adjacent CSS selector][adjacent](`+`) is used to change the styling of the image.

This technique isn't actually new, radio buttons have been a commonly used trick
for behaviour without Javascript - known as "[checkbox hack][checkbox-hack]".
Famously used for a [HTML + CSS version][css-minesweeper] of Minesweeper.

Since forms are available in e-mails and many clients support modern CSS it makes
sense this works, however this is the first time I've seen it. I found a couple
of [other][hamburger-email] [examples][click-bait] searching the web.

Nice work Dominos üëè
