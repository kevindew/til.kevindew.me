I'm a relatively new convertee to iTerm2 so I'm still getting to grips with the tricks. Here's a few I've found/used:

- **⌘↩** - Toggle Full screen
- **⌘⇧h** - View paste history
- **⌘;** - Autocomplete
- **⌘d** - Create a terminal splitting current one veritcally
- **⇧⌘d** - Create a terminal splitting current one horizontally
- **⌘←** and **⌘→** - Navigate tabs
- **⌘[** and **⌘]** - Navigate panes

When in search mode (**⌘f**):
- **↩** - Copy current item
- **⇥** - Expand selection left
- **⇧⇥** - Expand selection right

Make sure to select regular expression search mode 👌

You can set a hot key to switch to and from iTerm from whatever app you are in via Preferences. I've gone for **⇧§**.

Writing this I also found a [great website](https://web.archive.org/web/20141217110717/http://mackeys.info/) for getting the unicode characters for Mac keys.
